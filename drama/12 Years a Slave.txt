12 Years a Slave is a 2013 biographical drama film directed by Steve McQueen from a screenplay by John Ridley, 
based on the 1853 slave memoir Twelve Years a Slave by Solomon Northup, an African-American who was kidnapped in Washington, 
D.C. by two conmen in 1841 and sold into slavery. He was put to work on plantations in the state of Louisiana for 
12 years before being released. The first scholarly edition of Wilson's version of Northup's story was co-edited in 
1968 by Sue Eakin and Joseph Logsdon.[4]
